            <h2 id="what-is-gemini">What is Gemini AI?</h2>
            <p>
              Gemini AI is Google's most capable and general AI model to date, designed to understand and process multiple types of information simultaneously. Launched in December 2023, Gemini represents the culmination of Google's extensive research and development in artificial intelligence, specifically created to offer a more intuitive, helpful, and versatile AI assistant experience.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Unlike its predecessors and many competitors, Gemini was built from the ground up to be multimodal, meaning it can seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, images, and video. This native multimodality allows Gemini to process and respond to complex queries that involve multiple formats of information, making it exceptionally versatile for a wide range of applications.
