          <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
          <p>ChatGPT is an advanced AI language model developed by OpenAI, designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the prompts it receives. Released in November 2022, ChatGPT quickly became one of the fastest-growing consumer applications in history, reaching over 100 million users within just two months of its launch.</p>
          
          <p>At its core, ChatGPT is built on a large language model (LLM) that has been trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, books, articles, and other sources. This training allows it to understand context, generate coherent responses, and assist with a wide range of tasksâ€”from answering questions and writing content to helping with coding and creative projects.</p>
          
          <h2>How ChatGPT Works</h2>
          <p>ChatGPT operates through a process called "generative AI," which means it can create new content rather than simply retrieving pre-written answers. When you enter a prompt, ChatGPT:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Processes your input to understand the context and intent</li>
            <li>Draws on its training data to formulate a relevant response</li>
            <li>Generates text that attempts to be helpful, harmless, and honest</li>
            <li>Presents this response in a conversational format</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>The model maintains context throughout a conversation, allowing for back-and-forth exchanges that build on previous messages. This creates a more natural and useful interaction compared to traditional search engines or simple chatbots.</p>

          <h2>The Art of Prompt Writing</h2>
          <p>Learning to write effective prompts is perhaps the most important skill for getting the most out of ChatGPT. A well-crafted prompt can make the difference between a vague, unhelpful response and a detailed, accurate answer that perfectly addresses your needs.</p>
          
          <p>In this module, we'll explore the principles of effective prompt writing and provide practical examples to help you master this essential skill.</p>
          
          <h3>Basic Prompt Structure</h3>
          <p>While there's no single "correct" way to write a prompt, most effective prompts include these elements:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Clear instruction</strong>: What exactly do you want ChatGPT to do?</li>
            <li><strong>Necessary context</strong>: What background information is needed?</li>
            <li><strong>Format specification</strong>: How should the response be structured?</li>
            <li><strong>Scope or constraints</strong>: Any limitations or specific focus areas?</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Here's a simple template you can adapt for many situations:</p>
          
          <pre>
          [Instruction] about [Topic]. Include [Specific elements]. Format as [Desired format]. Keep it [Scope/Constraints].
          </pre>
          
          <h3>Examples of Basic Prompts</h3>
          
          <h4>Example 1: Simple Question</h4>
          <p><strong>Poor prompt:</strong> "Mars"</p>
          <p><strong>Better prompt:</strong> "What are the key facts about Mars, including its size, distance from the Sun, and notable features?"</p>
          
          <h4>Example 2: Writing Request</h4>
          <p><strong>Poor prompt:</strong> "Write about climate change"</p>
          <p><strong>Better prompt:</strong> "Write a 300-word explanation of climate change for high school students. Include the main causes, potential consequences, and three actions individuals can take to help."</p>
          
          <h4>Example 3: Problem Solving</h4>
          <p><strong>Poor prompt:</strong> "Help with math"</p>
          <p><strong>Better prompt:</strong> "I need to solve this quadratic equation: 2xÂ² + 5x - 3 = 0. Please show me the step-by-step solution using the quadratic formula."</p>

            title: "Advanced Prompting Techniques",
            content: `
              <p>Once you're comfortable with basic prompts, you can explore these advanced techniques to get even better results:</p>
              
              <h4>Role Prompting</h4>
              <p>Ask ChatGPT to adopt a specific role or perspective:</p>
              <pre>
              "Act as an experienced [profession/role] and help me with [task]."
              </pre>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Act as an experienced financial advisor and help me create a budget plan for a family of four with a monthly income of $6,000."</p>
              
              <h4>Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h4>
              <p>Encourage step-by-step reasoning:</p>
              <pre>
              "Think through this problem step by step: [problem]"
              </pre>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> "Think through this problem step by step: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is discounted by 30%, then further discounted by an additional 15%, what is the final price?"</p>
              
              <h4>Few-Shot Learning</h4>
              <p>Provide examples of what you want:</p>
              <pre>
              "I want you to [task]. Here are some examples:
              Example 1: [input] â†’ [desired output]
              Example 2: [input] â†’ [desired output]
              Now do the same for: [new input]"
              </pre>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I want you to rewrite sentences to be more engaging. Here are some examples:<br>
              Example 1: 'The cat sat on the mat.' â†’ 'The sleek feline lounged lazily on the weathered welcome mat.'<br>
              Example 2: 'He went to the store.' â†’ 'He dashed to the corner store, dodging raindrops along the way.'<br>
              Now do the same for: 'She read a book.'"</p>

            title: "Common Prompt Mistakes to Avoid",
            content: `
              <p>Even experienced ChatGPT users sometimes make these common prompting mistakes:</p>
              
              <h4>Being Too Vague</h4>
              <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Vague prompts like "Tell me about history" or "Help me with marketing" are too broad.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Be specific about what aspect of the topic you're interested in and what kind of help you need.</p>
              
              <h4>Overloading with Instructions</h4>
              <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Cramming too many requests into one prompt can overwhelm the model.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Break complex tasks into a series of simpler prompts, building on previous responses.</p>
              
              <h4>Not Providing Enough Context</h4>
              <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Assuming ChatGPT knows your specific situation or background information.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Provide relevant context, especially for personalized advice or specific scenarios.</p>
              
              <h4>Unclear Formatting Requests</h4>
              <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Asking for content in a particular format without specifying the details.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Clearly describe the format you want, or better yet, provide an example of the desired output structure.</p>
              
              <h4>Not Iterating and Refining</h4>
              <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Giving up if the first response isn't exactly what you wanted.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Treat prompting as a conversationâ€”refine your request based on the initial response to get closer to your desired outcome.</p>
